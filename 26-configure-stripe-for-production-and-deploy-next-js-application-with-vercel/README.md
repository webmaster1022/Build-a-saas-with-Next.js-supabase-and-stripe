**[ðŸ“¹ Video](https://egghead.io/lessons/supabase-configure-stripe-for-production-and-deploy-next-js-application-with-vercel)**

There are a few steps to go through to push our application and all of our services to production!

1. In order to "activate" our Stripe account, we need to fill out some details about our business.
2. Update everywhere [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) is referenced in our application to use the CLIENT_URL environment variable, which can be set to localhost in .env.local.
3. Create a GitHub repo, and commit and push all of our changes.
4. Create a Vercel account, import project from GitHub, configure all environment variables and deploy!
5. Use our Vercel domain to configure our Customer Portal and Webhooks in Stripe.
6. Update STRIPE_SIGNING_SECRET environment variable in Vercel and manually redeploy.
7. Update our Site URL in Supabase and remove our test user and profile records.
8. Create a function hook in Supabase to use our Vercel domain

We now have a SaaS application deployed to the Internet that we can start making that side hustle money from!! ðŸŽ‰
