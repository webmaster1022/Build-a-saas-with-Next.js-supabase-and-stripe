# Charge Customer for Stripe Subscription in Next.js

**[ðŸ“¹ Video](https://egghead.io/lessons/next-js-charge-customer-for-stripe-subscription-in-next-js)**

Stripe makes taking payments easy. We can use the Stripe library to create a checkout session. This takes a configuration object, which describes how we want to charge our customer, the method we would like to use, and where we want to redirect the user based on a successful transaction or cancellation.

In this video, we create a new API route to initiate a Stripe session to charge for a particular subscription option. This API route returns the session's ID, which we can use to redirect the client. In order to do this, we install the stripe-js library - which is used client-side to interact with Stripe - and initialize it using our publishable key.

Lastly, we can use the test credit card for Stripe to confirm everything is working in test mode.
